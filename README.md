# python-filer
What this will do is scan your current directory and take your file input (must be a real file and dont forget to add the file format). It will take the file input and find the folder that has a similar name (SequenceMatcher) and will automatically put you input into that folder. In the beginning make sure to specify how many files you want to put in.
