# python-filer
What this will do is scan your current directory and take your file input (must be a real file and dont forget to add the file format). It will take the file input and find the folder that has a similar name (SequenceMatcher) and will automatically put you input into that folder. In the beginning make sure to specify how many files you want to put in.


soon  new update where for example in photoshop when you finish and save a file it will automatically go to the most similar folders (directory rules still apply).
This will apply for any type of a file. This program only looks at the files name not extension.
